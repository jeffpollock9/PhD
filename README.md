# PhD

A dump of some of the stuff I wrote during my PhD thesis at
Heriot-Watt university. Looking back at some of the code makes me want
to cry a little.

Unfortunately it will require a bit of work to get working again, as I
lost a lot of files on my (very) old laptop, but hopefully most of the
guts are here.
